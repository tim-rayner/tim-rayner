# Hi 👋🏼

I'm [Tim](https://timrayner.com), a full stack engineer based in the UK.

I've been solving problems with code since before I can remember, with a particular passion in implementing great **user experience**. 

Outside of coding, you'll probably find me enjoying the outside with my two dogs 🐶 or playing video games with friends 🎮. 
I'm an outgoing individual with a passion for music and code 🎧 and am always looking for ways to better my game 📈

**Fun Facts:**
- I started coding when I was 14
- Hip Hop/Rap is my absolute **favourite** music genre 🎶
